<h2>About: </h2>
<p>The user can register a mayor, their municipality and their companies</p>

- Registering mayor: the user can register the mayor's name, SSN, city that they work...
- Registering municipality: the user can register the city and the mayor's name (the system associates the mayor with the municipality).
- Registering companies: the user can register the name, LLC, how many employees there are in the company...

<p>Then the system calculates the tributes that the companies have to pay, how much the municipality will collect... </p>
<p>The user can see these values and register a new company at any time, but they can only register one mayor and municipality, if they register another, the antecedent is going to be deleted.</p>
